> Design healthy and varied diet perfectly for you! 

Designing healthy and balanced diet requires a lot of knowledge, research and time in order to  calculate appropriate amount of necessary nutrients without forgetting to consume all of them daily. What's more, you should appreciate what you are eating, have varied dishes that suits you perfectly. We are here to make this task easier for you!

This project will be created to help people calculate a proper amount of nutrient he/she will need to consume during the week according to some personal information the user will have to provide us with. These would include some personal measurements such as height, weight, etc. and some additional information based on what he/she eats or does not eat.
