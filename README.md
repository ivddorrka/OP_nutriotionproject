# Nutrition Assistant

This project will be created to help people calculate a proper amount of nutrient he/she will need to consume during the week according to some personal information the user will have to provide us with. These would include some personal measurements such as height, weight etc and some additional information based on what he/she eats or does not eat.

# What it is going to look like?

This will be a web app having a few pages, where user will be able to registrate, enter his/her measurements afterwards and get a menu for the week with a possibility to change some food by another.
